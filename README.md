Problem Statement: App-Based Solution to identify and solve diseases in plants/crops

We made an app which is built using Java, XML and Firebase for data storage and user authentication and Python for ML. Utilizing a dataset of 200,000+ images, our CNN model swiftly identifies the top three potential plant diseases via photo analysis, enabling precise plant health diagnostics. Our user-friendly app offers actionable solutions and connects farmers with experts, streamlining disease resolution and enhancing crop productivity.

Features:

Disease Solution Suggestions: The model offers recommended treatments and preventive measures for identified diseases.

Expert Consultation: Users can seek guidance from agricultural experts through the app for personalized advice.

Real-time Support: Provides immediate assistance, aiding timely disease management.

Enhanced User Confidence: Builds trust by offering expert insights alongside AI-driven recommendations.

Comprehensive Support: Combines AI technology with human expertise for holistic disease management.
